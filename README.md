# GameStreamRotator

If a GameSream server has its primary monitor set to portrait orientation, then when a GameStream session is started the client will show the stream rotated.

This program rotates the primary monitor to the default landscape orientation when GameStream is started and reverts this change when GameStream is stopped.

GameScreamRotator.exe must be run with administrator permissions.
